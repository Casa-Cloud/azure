# Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role

## What Does --admin Do?
1. Retrieves cluster administrator credentials.
2. Bypasses Kubernetes RBAC restrictions.
3. Grants full access to all Kubernetes resources (nodes, workloads, configurations, secrets).
4. Uses a client certificate for authentication instead of Azure AD.
5. Allows users to run kubectl commands without additional Kubernetes RoleBindings.

## Difference between ClusterAdmin User and default clusterUsers

| **Feature**                         | **Default (`clusterUser`)** | **With `--admin`** |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------|
| **Authentication Type**              | Azure AD Token | Client Certificate |
| **Requires Kubernetes RBAC?**        | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (Bypasses RBAC) |
| **Can View Pods, Deployments, Nodes?** | ❌ No (Unless RBAC is assigned) | ✅ Yes (Full access) |
| **Can Modify Cluster Resources?**    | ❌ No (RBAC-controlled) | ✅ Yes |
| **Can Assign Kubernetes RoleBindings?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Can Run Cluster Management Commands?** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

### Key Takeaways:
1. Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role is for managing AKS infrastructure (not workloads inside Kubernetes).
2. If you need inside Kubernetes access (kubectl access to pods, namespaces, deployments), you must assign AKS-specific RBAC roles (RBAC Admin, RBAC Writer, RBAC Reader).
3. Monitoring & Log Access needs separate roles (Monitoring Reader, Log Analytics Reader, Monitoring Contributor).
